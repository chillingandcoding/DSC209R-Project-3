    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This interactive visualization intends to compare the GDP per capita across different countries from years 1960–2020. It highlights the economic growth patterns and major events such as the 2008 global recession. Users can select corresponding countries to explore how the regional economies would evolve over time.</p>

    <p>Our goal for this project is to explore the global GDP growth patterns using an interactive and comparative visualization. We keep the United States as a static baseline to help our users better understanding other countries’ trends.</p>

    <p>This visualization utilizes a line chart with a clear color and regional grouping in order to help us to emphasizing on how the economies evolved across time and geography. In addition, we annotated some major global events, such as the 2008 recession, to explain the sudden changes in GDP.</p>
    
    <p>For this project, our team collaborated through using GitHub and Slack. We learn to merge updates and refine the D3 interactions step by step and graduatelly improve our visualization. We obtain some feedbacks from our TA during the live session and the checkpoint comments, which helped us clarify the takeaway. Our design of this visualization and data transformation could help the users better understanding the economic shift and exploring the GDP trends globally.</p>
